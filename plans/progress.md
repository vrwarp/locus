## Session 40
- **Implemented:**
    - **Pastoral Co-Pilot (Beta):**
        - Created `src/utils/copilot.ts` with natural language processing logic (`processQuery`) for intents:
            - Health Score
            - Burnout Risk
            - Recruitment Candidates
            - Ghosts
            - Grade Search
            - Person Search
        - Created `src/components/CoPilot.tsx` (and `.css`) as a chat interface with typing indicators and card-based responses.
        - Integrated Co-Pilot into `App.tsx` and `Sidebar.tsx`.
    - **Test Coverage Improvements:**
        - Created `src/utils/copilot.test.ts` to verify NLP logic.
        - Created `src/components/CoPilot.test.tsx` to verify chat interactions.
        - Created `src/components/Sidebar.test.tsx` to verify navigation.
        - Created `src/components/Dashboard.test.tsx` to verify dashboard metrics.
        - Created `src/components/FamilyModal.test.tsx` to verify family audit rendering.
- **Tests:**
    - All new tests passing.
    - Full regression test suite passing.
- **Status:** Pastoral Co-Pilot integrated and functional.

## Session 41
- **Implemented:**
    - **Generation Stack Visualization:**
        - Created `src/components/GenerationStack.tsx` utilizing Recharts `BarChart` to display a stacked demographic view of students grouped by generation (Gen Z, Millennials, etc.).
        - Integrated the component into `src/App.tsx` and added corresponding navigation entry to `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` under 'Intelligence'.
    - **Test Coverage:**
        - Added `src/components/GenerationStack.test.tsx` to verify correct rendering of demographic data.
        - Updated `src/components/Sidebar.test.tsx` to ensure proper routing functionality for the new view.
- **Tests:**
    - Full test suite run and passed (51 passing test suites, 291 tests).
- **Status:** Generation Stack visualization complete and verified.
- **Discovered:**
    - The Recharts `ResponsiveContainer` requires explicit height constraints on its parent element to prevent layout collapse.
    - Vitest JS DOM struggles with measuring DOM elements for Recharts, requiring custom mocked components for `ResponsiveContainer` and `BarChart` to allow the tests to pass without warnings or errors.
- **Future Ideas:**
    - Drill-down capability: Clicking on a generation bar (e.g., 'Gen Z') should filter the main `Data Health` scatter plot to only show those individuals.
    - Export functionality: Provide a button to download the demographic chart as a PNG or PDF for the `Robert Report` (Executive view).
