## 2. Narrative Arc 1: The Skeptic's Conversion
*A story of how Dr. Robert went from budget-cutter to Locus champion.*

**Scene:** The Monday Morning Staff Meeting. Tension is high.
**Conflict:** Dr. Robert is reviewing the software budget. "We spend $5,000 a month on SaaS. We need to cut."

**The Action:**
1.  **The Challenge:** Robert points to the line item for "Locus - $99/mo." He asks, "What is this? Doesn't Planning Center do this?"
2.  **The Defense:** Sarah doesn't argue. She connects her laptop to the projector.
3.  **The Demo:** She opens Locus.
    *   She clicks "Projector Mode" (High contrast, large text).
    *   She navigates to the "Groups vs. Attendance" Scatter Plot (Enterprise Feature).
4.  **The Reveal:** "Robert, look at this cluster here." She circles a group of red dots in the top right quadrant.
    *   *Data Point:* Active Online, Zero Physical Attendance (Last 6 months).
5.  **The Insight:** "These are 15 families who are effectively 'digital ghosts'. They open emails, but they haven't checked in since Easter. We are about to lose them."
6.  **The Realization:** Robert adjusts his glasses. "That's... 15 families at risk of disconnecting."
7.  **The Resolution:** Robert looks at Sarah. "Can we export that list? I want to call them personally."
8.  **The Aftermath:** Robert approves the budget. He now has Locus bookmarked on his iPad.

## 3. Narrative Arc 2: The Gamified Grind
*A story of turning "Administrative Fatigue" into "Dopamine Hits".*

**Context:** It's 4:00 PM on a Friday. Sarah is exhausted. She has 200 records to review before the weekend. In the old days, she would have quit and gone home.

**The Action:**
1.  **The Login:** She opens Locus. The "Daily Goal" widget shows: "0/50 Records Fixed".
2.  **The Streak:** A flame icon shows "4 Day Streak". She doesn't want to break it.
3.  **The Flow State:** She enters "Rapid Fire Mode". The UI strips away everything but the next record.
    *   *Record 1:* "Timmy, Age 10, Grade 2." -> Click "Fix to Grade 5". *Ping!*
    *   *Record 2:* "Sarah, Age 3, Grade 1." -> Click "Fix to Pre-K". *Ping!*
4.  **The Combo:** She hits 10 in a row without skipping. The screen edges glow gold. The sound effects pitch up slightly with each click. She is in the zone.
5.  **The Boss Battle:** She encounters a "Complex Family" error (3 kids, different last names, no parents).
    *   She uses the "Sandbox" tool to model the merge. It works. She commits.
    *   *Big Sound:* "BOSS DEFEATED."
6.  **The Reward:** A modal pops up: **"Badge Unlocked: The Archeologist (Fixed 50 records > 5 years old)."**
7.  **The Feeling:** She leans back. She's not tired. She's energized. She did 200 records in 20 minutes.

## 4. Narrative Arc 3: The Volunteer's Nightmare
*A story of Safety, Error, and Redemption.*

**Scene:** Thursday afternoon. Emily is preparing labels for the "Fall Kickoff."

**The Problem:** Emily needs to print name tags for the "Little Lambs" (Ages 2-3) class. She exports the list from PCO and prints 50 labels.
**The Disaster:** On Sunday morning, a 12-year-old boy named "Michael" walks up. His name tag is waiting in the "Little Lambs" pile. His friends see it. They laugh. Michael is humiliated. He refuses to go to class. His mom is furious.

**The Diagnosis (Post-Mortem with Locus):**
1.  **The Investigation:** Sarah logs into Locus on Monday.
2.  **The Visualization:** She filters for "Name: Michael."
3.  **The Anomaly:** She sees Michael's dot.
    *   *Y-Axis (Grade):* 7th Grade.
    *   *X-Axis (Age):* 2.5 years old.
4.  **The Cause:** Someone (probably Emily) typed "2021" instead of "2011" for his birth year. PCO didn't catch it because "2021" is a valid date.
5.  **The Solution:** Locus *did* catch it. It was a bright red dot screaming "Age/Grade Mismatch." If Sarah had checked Locus on Friday, Michael wouldn't have been embarrassed.

**The New Protocol:**
1.  **The Pre-Flight Check:** Every Friday at 2 PM, Sarah opens Locus.
2.  **The Sweep:** She checks the "New Records" bucket (people added in the last 7 days).
3.  **The Catch:** She spots a new typo ("Grade 35" instead of "Grade 5").
4.  **The Fix:** Click -> Edit -> Save.
5.  **The Result:** A boring Sunday. No drama. Just ministry.

## 5. Narrative Arc 4: The Safe Experiment
*How the "Sandbox" feature saved Sarah from a nervous breakdown.*

**Context:** The Youth Pastor wants to "promote" all 8th graders to 9th grade *early* for a special summer event. This affects 150 students.

**The Fear:** Sarah knows that if she messes this up, check-in will be broken for 3 months. In PCO, bulk actions are terrifyingly permanent.

**The Action:**
1.  **The Simulation:** Sarah opens Locus and toggles "Sandbox Mode" (The header turns a comforting Blue color).
2.  **The Experiment:** She runs a query: `Grade == 8`.
    *   She applies a bulk action: `Set Grade = 9`.
3.  **The Preview:** Locus generates a "Future State" scatter plot.
    *   She sees the dots move.
    *   *Warning:* Locus flags 3 students. "These 3 students are only 11 years old. Are you sure they are 8th graders?"
4.  **The Catch:** "Oh! Those are the geniuses who skipped a grade. But they aren't going to the High School retreat yet."
5.  **The Adjustment:** She removes those 3 from the selection.
6.  **The Commit:** She clicks "Apply to Live Database."
    *   *Locus:* "Are you sure? Type 'CONFIRM' to proceed."
7.  **The Outcome:** 147 records updated perfectly. 3 disasters avoided. Zero panic attacks.

## 6. Narrative Arc 5: The Super-Node Discovery
*Using "The Genealogy Project" to find the key to the community.*

**Context:** Pastor Mike is trying to launch a new Small Group initiative. He needs "Connectors"—people who know everyone.

**The Search:**
1.  **The Tool:** Mike logs into Locus and clicks the "Genealogy" tab (Beta).
2.  **The Graph:** The screen fills with a "Spiderweb" of lines connecting profile pictures.
3.  **The Filter:** He sets the view to "Generation Z" + "Served in last 3 months."
4.  **The Anomaly:** He sees a massive node in the center. It's not a staff member. It's "Brenda," a quiet college student.
5.  **The Data:** The lines show she has "Invited" 12 people, "Shared a Group" with 30 people, and "Volunteered" with 4 teams.
6.  **The Action:** Mike calls Brenda. "You are the key to this whole thing."
7.  **The Result:** Brenda becomes the lead coordinator. The initiative explodes. Locus found a leader that the org chart missed.

## 7. Narrative Arc 6: The Sunday Morning General
*Dr. Robert uses the VR War Room.*

**Context:** It is Easter Sunday. 3,000 people are expected.

**The Scene:** Dr. Robert is in his office. He puts on his headset (or opens the iPad AR view).

**The View:**
1.  **The Lobby:** He sees a heatmap overlay on the lobby camera feed. "Density Critical near the Coffee Bar."
2.  **The Decision:** He radios the Ushers: "Shift Team B to the Coffee Bar, we have a bottleneck."
3.  **The Nursery:** He sees a blinking red light over the Kids Wing. "Check-in latency > 45 seconds."
4.  **The Fix:** "Tech team, reboot Kiosk 4. It's slowing down the line."
5.  **The Feeling:** He is not reacting to complaints; he is preventing them. He feels like a conductor.

## 8. Narrative Arc 7: The GDPR Panic
*When compliance becomes cool.*

**Context:** A "Right to be Forgotten" request comes in from a former member who left on bad terms. They want *all* their data deleted.

**The Risk:** In PCO, deleting a person is easy. But what about their child's check-in history? The attendance stats? Deleting them might break historical reports.

**The Locus Shield:**
1.  **The Request:** Sarah selects the person in Locus and clicks "Compliance Purge".
2.  **The Analysis:** Locus scans the entire graph.
    *   *Alert:* "User has attendance history. Cannot delete. Must Anonymize."
3.  **The Action:** Sarah confirms "Anonymize".
4.  **The Magic:**
    *   Name becomes "Anonymized User 14205".
    *   Address is scrubbed.
    *   Photo is deleted.
    *   *However:* The historical attendance data remains in the Archive, attached to the anonymous ID.
5.  **The Receipt:** Locus generates a PDF "Certificate of Erasure" for Sarah to send to the former member.
6.  **The Relief:** Legal compliance achieved. Data integrity preserved.

## 9. Narrative Arc 8: The Great Migration
*Switching platforms without losing your mind.*

**Context:** The church board has voted to switch from "Rock RMS" to "Planning Center". Sarah is terrified. Migrations are where data goes to die.

**The Bridge:**
1.  **The Connection:** Sarah connects Locus to *both* APIs (The "Bridge" Feature).
2.  **The Comparison:** Locus displays a "Dual-Scatter" view.
    *   *Left:* Rock RMS data (Blue dots).
    *   *Right:* Planning Center data (Orange dots).
3.  **The Diff:** Locus highlights "350 Records Mismatched".
    *   "In Rock, Timmy is Grade 4. In PCO, Timmy is Grade 5."
4.  **The Sync:** Sarah clicks "Resolve to Highest Grade".
    *   Locus pushes the update to PCO to match the latest truth.
5.  **The Validation:** Once the dots align perfectly, she knows the data migration is 100% accurate.
6.  **The Sign-off:** She signs the contract with PCO, knowing her data is clean.

## 10. Narrative Arc 9: The Invisible Hand
*Locus Automate takes the wheel.*

**Context:** It is 2 AM. Sarah is asleep.

**The Trigger:** A teenager, "Kyle," turns 18 at midnight.

**The Old Way:** Kyle stays in the "High School" folder until Sarah remembers to move him in June. He keeps getting emails about "Prom Night" even though he's in college. He gets annoyed and unsubscribes.

**The Locus Way (Automate):**
1.  **The Monitor:** Locus Automate wakes up. `Trigger: Birthday = Today AND Age = 18`.
2.  **The Action:**
    *   *Move:* `Folder: High School` -> `Folder: Young Adults`.
    *   *Tag:* Add tag `Transition: Graduated`.
    *   *Communication:* Send email template `Welcome_To_Adulthood_Coffee_Invite`.
3.  **The Notification:** Sarah wakes up to a push notification: "Locus successfully transitioned Kyle to Young Adults."
4.  **The Result:** Kyle feels seen. Sarah slept through the whole thing.

## 11. Micro-Journeys: The UI Physics
*Detailed breakdown of specific interactions.*

### 11.1 The "Hover of Truth"
**Goal:** To inspect a data point without losing context.
*   **Trigger:** User moves mouse over a dot.
*   **Response (< 10ms):**
    *   The dot scales up 150%.
    *   A "Tooltip Card" snaps into existence.
    *   *Card Content:* Profile Photo (Circle), Full Name (Bold), Age (calculated), Grade (recorded), and the "Delta" (e.g., "-2 years").
    *   *Background:* The rest of the chart dims slightly (10% opacity reduction) to focus attention.
    *   *Connecting Lines:* Faint lines draw from the dot to the X and Y axes to show exact position.

### 11.2 The "Magnetic Correction"
**Goal:** To fix a grade error with satisfying physics.
*   **Trigger:** User clicks a dot that is off the diagonal.
*   **Action:** A modal appears: "Fix Grade".
*   **Interaction:** The user drags a slider for "Grade".
*   **Feedback:** As the slider moves, a "Ghost Dot" moves on the chart in real-time.
*   **The Snap:** When the slider hits the correct grade (matching the age), the Ghost Dot snaps to the "Diagonal of Truth" line and glows Green.
*   **Commit:** User releases the slider. The real dot animates to the new position with a "Spring" physics curve.
*   **Sound:** A subtle "Click" sound plays.

### 11.3 The "Lasso" Select
**Goal:** Bulk action.
*   **Action:** User holds "Shift" and clicks-and-drags on the chart background.
*   **Visual:** A semi-transparent blue selection polygon follows the cursor.
*   **Selection:** All dots inside the polygon turn Blue.
*   **Context Menu:** A floating toolbar appears next to the selection:
    *   [Edit Grade]
    *   [Add to List]
    *   [Archive]
    *   [Email]

## 12. The "Crisis" Scenario: The Big Migration
*A high-stress journey.*

**Context:** The church has just acquired a smaller church ("The Merger"). They are importing 500 new people into the database today.

**Hour 0: The Dump**
*   The CSV is imported. It is a mess. Formats are wrong. "M" and "F" are "Male" and "Female". Birthdates are "DD/MM/YYYY" mixed with "MM/DD/YYYY".

**Hour 1: The Panic**
*   Sarah opens PCO. It looks fine on the surface.
*   She opens Locus. **It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.** Dots are everywhere. There is no diagonal. Chaos.

**Hour 2: The Triage**
*   Sarah uses Locus's "Source Filter" to show only the new 500 records.
*   She sees a cluster of people listed as "123 years old." (Birth year 1900 - the default for missing data).
*   **Action:** Lasso Select -> "Set Birthdate to Null". Cleared.

**Hour 3: The Pattern**
*   She sees a diagonal line, but it's *perpendicular* to the correct one.
*   **Insight:** "Oh, the import swapped Age and Grade columns for the Kids Ministry."
*   **Action:** She selects the group. She opens the "Transformation Tool."
*   **Script:** "Swap Field: Grade <-> Field: Age (derived)."
*   **Result:** The perpendicular line rotates 90 degrees and snaps onto the Diagonal of Truth.

**Hour 4: Peace**
*   The chart looks clean. The merger is successful. Sarah goes home on time.

## 13. The "Onboarding" Experience (First 5 Minutes)

1.  **The Welcome:** "Hello, Guardian. Let's clean your house."
2.  **The Connection:** "Enter App ID / Secret." -> "Validating..." -> "Success."
3.  **The Loading Screen:** "Fetching 2,403 People... Calculating Ages... Identifying Ghosts... Polishing Pixels..."
4.  **The First Chart:** The chart loads with a dramatic animation (Staggered fade-in from left to right).
5.  **The "Wow" Moment:** A single spotlight shines on the "Worst Offender" (The biggest outlier).
    *   *Text:* "Meet John. He's listed as 84 years old in the Nursery. Let's fix him together."
6.  **The Tutorial:** User clicks "Fix". John moves.
7.  **The Reward:** "1 down. 43 anomalies to go. You've got this."
