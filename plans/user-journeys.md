**Context:** Budget meeting. Dr. Robert wants to cut Locus.
**The Turn:** Sarah shows him the **"Ghost Protocol"** report.
**The Insight:** "Robert, we have 45 active families who haven't checked in for 6 months because they serve. If we purge them (like you asked), we lose our volunteer base."
**The Result:** Robert sees the "Risk Averted" metric ($45,000 in potential giving retained). He approves the budget.

### 3. Narrative Arc 2: The Gamified Grind
*A story of Flow.*
**Context:** Friday, 4 PM. 200 anomalies.
**The Action:** Sarah enters **"Speed Run Mode"**.
**The Experience:**

*   *Fix 2:* "Birthdate Error." -> *Snap!* -> **D Major Chord.**
*   *Combo:* 10 fixes in 30 seconds. **Confetti!**
**The Result:** She clears the list in 15 minutes. She feels energized, not drained.

**The Insight:** Sarah realizes he skips check-in to set up amps.
**The Fix:** She tags him "Service Check-in".
**The Outcome:** Timmy stays in the system. He gets the invite to the summer retreat. He goes. He decides to go to seminary. **Data integrity changed a life.**

### 5. Narrative Arc 4: The Family Audit
