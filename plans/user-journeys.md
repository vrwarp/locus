## 2. Narrative Arc 1: The Skeptic's Conversion
*A story of how Dr. Robert went from budget-cutter to Locus champion.*

**Scene:** The Monday Morning Staff Meeting. Tension is high.
**Conflict:** Dr. Robert is reviewing the software budget. "We spend $5,000 a month on SaaS. We need to cut."

**The Action:**
1.  **The Challenge:** Robert points to the line item for "Locus - $99/mo." He asks, "What is this? Doesn't Planning Center do this?"
2.  **The Defense:** Sarah doesn't argue. She connects her laptop to the projector.
3.  **The Demo:** She opens Locus.
    *   She clicks "Projector Mode" (High contrast, large text).
    *   She navigates to the "Groups vs. Attendance" Scatter Plot.
4.  **The Reveal:** "Robert, look at this cluster here." She circles a group of red dots in the top right quadrant.
    *   *Data Point:* Active Online, Zero Physical Attendance (Last 6 months).
5.  **The Insight:** "These are 15 families who are effectively 'digital ghosts'. They open emails, but they haven't checked in since Easter. We are about to lose them."
6.  **The Realization:** Robert adjusts his glasses. "That's... 15 families at risk of disconnecting."
7.  **The Resolution:** Robert looks at Sarah. "Can we export that list? I want to call them personally."
8.  **The Aftermath:** Robert approves the budget. He now has Locus bookmarked on his iPad.

## 3. Narrative Arc 2: The Gamified Grind (Realized)
*A story of turning "Administrative Fatigue" into "Dopamine Hits".*

**Context:** It's 4:00 PM on a Friday. Sarah is exhausted. She has 200 anomalies flagged.

**The Action:**
1.  **The Login:** She opens Locus. The "Daily Goal" widget shows: "0/50 Records Fixed".
2.  **The Mode:** She clicks the "Start Review" button in the header. The interface shifts.
    *   The scatter plot fades back.
    *   A focused "Review Card" slides into the center.
3.  **The Flow State:** She enters "Rapid Fire Mode".
    *   *Record 1:* "Timmy, Age 10, Grade 2 (Delta -2)."
    *   *Decision:* She checks his birthdate. It's correct. He must have been held back. She clicks **"Skip"**.
    *   *Record 2:* "Sarah, Age 3, Grade 1 (Delta +2)."
    *   *Decision:* Clearly a typo. She clicks **"Fix Grade"**. The slider snaps to "Pre-K". She hits "Save".
    *   *Feedback:* **Confetti explodes!** A "Combo x2" counter appears.
4.  **The Combo:** She hits 10 in a row without skipping. The screen edges glow gold. The audio feedback plays a harmonic scale (C major) ascending with each fix.
5.  **The Reward:** A modal pops up: **"Badge Unlocked: The Archeologist (Fixed 50 records > 5 years old)."**
6.  **The Feeling:** She leans back. She's not tired. She's energized. She cleared the anomalies in 20 minutes.

## 4. Narrative Arc 3: The Ghost Rescue (New)
*A story of how the "Ghost Protocol" saved a student from being forgotten.*

**Context:** It's "Database Cleanup Day". Sarah's job is to archive inactive profiles to save money on the PCO subscription.

**The Danger:** Normally, she runs a report: "Not Checked In > 2 Years". She hits "Archive All".
*   *The Problem:* Timmy (16) hasn't checked in on Sunday morning because he plays in the worship band (which doesn't use the check-in kiosks). He is effectively invisible to the "Check-In" report.

**The Locus Intervention:**
1.  **The Protocol:** Sarah opens the **"Ghost Protocol"** modal in Locus.
2.  **The Analysis:** Locus scans 5,000 records. It identifies 450 "Ghosts".
3.  **The Rescue:** Locus highlights a sub-group: **"25 Ghosts Rescued"**.
    *   Sarah clicks to inspect.
    *   She sees Timmy's name.
    *   *Reason:* "No Check-ins (24mo), BUT Active in 'High School Worship Band' (Group Membership)."
4.  **The Insight:** "Oh my gosh, I almost archived our lead guitarist."
5.  **The Action:** She selects the "True Ghosts" (425 records) and clicks "Archive".
6.  **The Outcome:** The database is clean. Timmy is safe. The ministry data is accurate.

## 5. Narrative Arc 4: The Family Audit (New)
*A story of finding the errors that logic misses.*

**Context:** A new family visits. The data entry volunteer types fast and makes mistakes.

**The Error:** The volunteer enters the dad (John, 40) and the son (Little John, 5). But she swaps the birth years.
*   *PCO Data:* John is 5. Little John is 40.

**The Locus Catch:**
1.  **The Alert:** Sarah sees a red badge on the **"Family Logic"** button.
2.  **The Modal:** She opens the Family Audit.
3.  **The Anomaly:** It flags the "Smith Household".
    *   *Error Type:* **"Child Older Than Parent"**.
    *   *Detail:* "Little John (Child) is 35 years older than John (Head of Household)."
4.  **The Fix:** Sarah laughs. She clicks "Swap Birthdates".
5.  **The Verification:** Locus re-calculates. The error clears. The Green checkmark appears.
6.  **The Result:** The Youth Pastor doesn't accidentally invite the 40-year-old dad to the Kindergarten party.

## 6. Narrative Arc 5: The Safe Experiment (Realized)
*How the "Sandbox" feature saved Sarah from a nervous breakdown.*

**Context:** The Youth Pastor wants to "promote" all 8th graders to 9th grade *early* for a special summer event. This affects 150 students.

**The Fear:** Sarah knows that if she messes this up, check-in will be broken for 3 months. In PCO, bulk actions are terrifyingly permanent.

**The Action:**
1.  **The Simulation:** Sarah opens Locus and toggles **"Sandbox Mode"**.
    *   *Visual:* A bright orange banner appears: **"SANDBOX MODE ACTIVE"**. The header turns striped.
2.  **The Experiment:** She runs a query: `Grade == 8`.
    *   She applies a bulk action: `Set Grade = 9`.
3.  **The Preview:** Locus generates a "Future State" scatter plot.
    *   She sees the dots move.
    *   *Warning:* Locus flags 3 students. "These 3 students are only 11 years old. Are you sure they are 8th graders?"
4.  **The Catch:** "Oh! Those are the geniuses who skipped a grade. But they aren't going to the High School retreat yet."
5.  **The Adjustment:** She removes those 3 from the selection.
6.  **The Real Thing:** She toggles Sandbox Mode **OFF**.
7.  **The Commit:** She repeats the action.
    *   *Locus:* "Are you sure? Type 'CONFIRM' to proceed."
8.  **The Outcome:** 147 records updated perfectly. 3 disasters avoided. Zero panic attacks.

## 7. Narrative Arc 6: The Super-Node Discovery
*Using "The Genealogy Project" to find the key to the community.*

**Context:** Pastor Mike is trying to launch a new Small Group initiative. He needs "Connectors"—people who know everyone.

**The Search:**
1.  **The Tool:** Mike logs into Locus and clicks the "Genealogy" tab (Beta).
2.  **The Graph:** The screen fills with a "Spiderweb" of lines connecting profile pictures.
3.  **The Filter:** He sets the view to "Generation Z" + "Served in last 3 months."
4.  **The Anomaly:** He sees a massive node in the center. It's not a staff member. It's "Brenda," a quiet college student.
5.  **The Data:** The lines show she has "Invited" 12 people, "Shared a Group" with 30 people, and "Volunteered" with 4 teams.
6.  **The Action:** Mike calls Brenda. "You are the key to this whole thing."
7.  **The Result:** Brenda becomes the lead coordinator. The initiative explodes. Locus found a leader that the org chart missed.

## 8. Narrative Arc 7: The Sunday Morning General
*Dr. Robert uses the VR War Room.*

**Context:** It is Easter Sunday. 3,000 people are expected.

**The Scene:** Dr. Robert is in his office. He puts on his headset (or opens the iPad AR view).

**The View:**
1.  **The Lobby:** He sees a heatmap overlay on the lobby camera feed. "Density Critical near the Coffee Bar."
2.  **The Decision:** He radios the Ushers: "Shift Team B to the Coffee Bar, we have a bottleneck."
3.  **The Nursery:** He sees a blinking red light over the Kids Wing. "Check-in latency > 45 seconds."
4.  **The Fix:** "Tech team, reboot Kiosk 4. It's slowing down the line."
5.  **The Feeling:** He is not reacting to complaints; he is preventing them. He feels like a conductor.

## 9. Narrative Arc 8: The GDPR Panic
*When compliance becomes cool.*

**Context:** A "Right to be Forgotten" request comes in from a former member who left on bad terms. They want *all* their data deleted.

**The Risk:** In PCO, deleting a person is easy. But what about their child's check-in history? The attendance stats? Deleting them might break historical reports.

**The Locus Shield:**
1.  **The Request:** Sarah selects the person in Locus and clicks "Compliance Purge".
2.  **The Analysis:** Locus scans the entire graph.
    *   *Alert:* "User has attendance history. Cannot delete. Must Anonymize."
3.  **The Action:** Sarah confirms "Anonymize".
4.  **The Magic:**
    *   Name becomes "Anonymized User 14205".
    *   Address is scrubbed.
    *   Photo is deleted.
    *   *However:* The historical attendance data remains in the Archive, attached to the anonymous ID.
5.  **The Receipt:** Locus generates a PDF "Certificate of Erasure" for Sarah to send to the former member.
6.  **The Relief:** Legal compliance achieved. Data integrity preserved.

## 10. Narrative Arc 9: The Invisible Hand
*Locus Automate takes the wheel.*

**Context:** It is 2 AM. Sarah is asleep.

**The Trigger:** A teenager, "Kyle," turns 18 at midnight.

**The Old Way:** Kyle stays in the "High School" folder until Sarah remembers to move him in June. He keeps getting emails about "Prom Night" even though he's in college. He gets annoyed and unsubscribes.

**The Locus Way (Automate):**
1.  **The Monitor:** Locus Automate wakes up. `Trigger: Birthday = Today AND Age = 18`.
2.  **The Action:**
    *   *Move:* `Folder: High School` -> `Folder: Young Adults`.
    *   *Tag:* Add tag `Transition: Graduated`.
    *   *Communication:* Send email template `Welcome_To_Adulthood_Coffee_Invite`.
3.  **The Notification:** Sarah wakes up to a push notification: "Locus successfully transitioned Kyle to Young Adults."
4.  **The Result:** Kyle feels seen. Sarah slept through the whole thing.
