## Part 1: The Core Journeys (Current Reality)

### 2. Narrative Arc 1: The Skeptic's Conversion
*A story of ROI.*
**Context:** Budget meeting. Dr. Robert wants to cut Locus.
**The Turn:** Sarah shows him the **"Ghost Protocol"** report.
**The Insight:** "Robert, we have 45 active families who haven't checked in for 6 months because they serve. If we purge them (like you asked), we lose our volunteer base."
**The Result:** Robert sees the "Risk Averted" metric ($45,000 in potential giving retained). He approves the budget.

### 3. Narrative Arc 2: The Gamified Grind
*A story of Flow.*
**Context:** Friday, 4 PM. 200 anomalies.
**The Action:** Sarah enters **"Speed Run Mode"**.
**The Experience:**
*   *Fix 1:* "Grade Error." -> *Snap!* -> **C Major Chord.**
*   *Fix 2:* "Birthdate Error." -> *Snap!* -> **D Major Chord.**
*   *Combo:* 10 fixes in 30 seconds. **Confetti!**
**The Result:** She clears the list in 15 minutes. She feels energized, not drained.

### 4. Narrative Arc 3: The Ghost Rescue
*A story of saving a student.*
**Context:** Timmy (16) is about to be archived.
**The Save:** Locus flags him: "Warning: High School Band Member."
**The Insight:** Sarah realizes he skips check-in to set up amps.
**The Fix:** She tags him "Service Check-in".
**The Outcome:** Timmy stays in the system. He gets the invite to the summer retreat. He goes. He decides to go to seminary. **Data integrity changed a life.**

### 5. Narrative Arc 4: The Family Audit
*A story of awkward conversations avoided.*
**Context:** A volunteer enters a new family. Swaps "Husband" and "Son".
**The Catch:** **"Family Logic"** flags: "Child (40) is older than Parent (5)."
**The Fix:** Sarah swaps them with one click.
**The Relief:** The church doesn't send a "Welcome to Kindergarten" card to a 40-year-old man.

*   Mark missed Small Group 3 weeks in a row.
*   Mark was late to check-in 2 Sundays in a row.
**The Alert:** Jason (Campus Pastor) gets a "Yellow Alert" push notification.
**The Action:** Jason texts Mark: "Hey, just thinking about you. Coffee?"
**The Reveal:** Mark lost his job. He was embarrassed to tell anyone.

**The Pitch:** Brenda calls Sarah. "Hey, I know you're a teacher and your kid is in 3rd grade. We need someone exactly like you."
**The Reaction:** Sarah feels *known*, not used. "I was actually waiting for someone to ask."
**The Outcome:** A perfect volunteer placement.

### 8. Narrative Arc 7: The "Burnout Prevention" (New)
*A story of caring for the shepherds.*
**Context:** Linda serves on the Greeting Team, the Kids Team, and the Coffee Team. She is tired.

**The Insight:** Linda has served 8 weeks in a row without attending a service.
**The Alert:** Pastor Mike gets a notification: "Burnout Risk: Linda. She hasn't sat in a service in 2 months."
**The Action:** Mike approaches Linda. "Linda, you are off the schedule for the next month. We need you to rest."

**The New Way:** Dr. Robert opens Locus Chat on the big screen.
**The Interaction:**
*   *Robert:* "Locus, show me the average attendance of the 9 AM service for the last 6 months, excluding holiday weekends."
*   *Locus:* "Average is 450 adults. Capacity is 500. You are at 90% capacity."
*   *Robert:* "How many of those families live within 10 minutes of the church?"
*   *Locus:* "320 families (71%)."
**The Decision:** "Okay, we have the density. Let's launch."
